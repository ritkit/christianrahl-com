<h4 class="mt-4 mb-1">Hello</h4>
<p>
	Yes, that is me standing at the Geographic South Pole; no, it is not in Alaska but in Antarctica. 
	I am currently at Palmer Station on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Since late 2019, I 
	have spent three years in Antarctica as a Senior Network Engineer with the Antarctic Support Contract. 
	It is pretty cold, having spent time outside at -105.5 F (-76.4 C). This program has been quite an 
	experience, and I will write some posts about it. In the meantime, more about me.

<h4 class="mt-4 mb-1">Networking</h4>

		My journey in networking began in high school, where I enrolled in two classes offered in partnership 
		between the local community college and my high school. This early interest blossomed into a college 
		focus on networking, computer science, mathematics, and communications. Post-graduation, I delved into 
		various networking areas, from ISP to enterprise, TAC, and professional services, showcasing my 
		dedication to this field.

		Outside of my professional life, I am an adventurer at heart, constantly seeking new experiences. My 
		two favorite interests, biking and traveling, perfectly reflect this. I've cycled nearly the entire 
		length of New Zealand and regularly embark on gravel and mountain bike rides. I also find time to 
		volunteer, supporting local non-profits in their IT infrastructure. My adventurous spirit also extends to 
		my role as an Amateur Radio operator, photographer, DJ, and other side projects.

<h4 class="mt-4 mb-1">What is next?</h4>
<p>
	I am nearing the end of my third winter and 1000 days in Antarctica. I will depart from Palmer station in 
	October 2024 and take a much-needed vacation. After the vacation, I will continue my job hunt. I will also 
	spend time with people I have been away from for 6 months. I will continue updating and migrating this website. 
	Plus I have a few other projects I want to take care of.
