Well it is time to experience a different kind of Drake one that sings of ice scratching along the hull of a ship. So not very different from the artist Drake.

But I digress. I write this from Aft Control on the ship Nathaniel B Palmer (NBP) heading back to Punta Arenas. I have just finished my third winter in Antarctica at Palmer station. If you are wondering yes there is a ship and a station named after Nathaniel B Palmer. The guy was just that influential in the Antarctic science. [Here is a good article]() about his impact. So I sit rolling in the seas on the Palmer leaving Palmer.

As for the Drake reference, it is one of the more infamous seas in the world. Magelline actively avoided it during his trip around the world passing through the area near Punta Arenas and eventually being named after him, the Straits of Megelline. Either way the Drake has two states, the Drake lake, or the Drake shake. You hope for the first and pray the second will not be terrible. In a modern icebreaking ship there is zero concern about the crossing. The only vulnerability on the Drake is the humans inside being tossed around.

We started with the lake and the sea state has detioriated to 20 maybe 30 ft waves with long periods. This means we are pitching and rolling quite a bit but at a fairly reliable rate. Imagine being on a winding road with small hills, thats what it feels here. If you were reading a book in that car you would likely feel a little disorientated, that is about the same feeling I have currently. Not nauseous, just annoyinghly dizzy like I spun around on a meri-go-round a little too long.

The nausea is a price I am more than willing to pay for the reward that was winter at Palmer station.
