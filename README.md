# Christian Rahl Personal Site
This is my personal site. The goal being a place to share notes I have taken over many years.

## Thanks to
- Theme from [Void Astro](eAntillon/void-astro)
- Github Actions from [Astros Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/aws/)
- Google as always (who does anything without googling)

## Design goals

- **Minimalistic Design** - KISS for design.
- **Dark Mode** - everything I do is dark.
- **Responsive** - supports both mobile and desktop
- **Automated** - I do not want to be uploading files manually.
- **Flexible Design** - Can easily support growing.
- **Adaptable** - Can migrate the server to new hosts if someone becomes to expensive

## Roadmap
- [ ] Initial Site Rollout
- [ ] Migrate some old blog posts
- [ ] Add cheat sheet page
- [ ] Create an Album section
